**Feature Engineering** in machine learning (ML) is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that improve the performance of machine learning models. It involves selecting, creating, modifying, and optimizing features (input variables) to help the model better capture patterns in the data. Effective feature engineering can significantly boost model accuracy, interpretability, and training efficiency.
