- **Clustering** in machine learning is a fundamental **unsupervised learning** technique used to group a set of data points into clusters based on their similarities.
- The primary objective of clustering is to organize data in such a way that points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.
- This similarity is typically defined based on distance metrics or other similarity measures relevant to the data.

# Types of Clustering
- [[K-Means Clustering]]
