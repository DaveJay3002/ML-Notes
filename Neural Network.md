A **neural network** is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes, called **neurons**, which are designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and [[Machine Learning]] tasks.

Also known as, Deep learning, when the traditional algorithm could give satisfactory results for large amount of data and on data that is in the form of images, sound, etc.
