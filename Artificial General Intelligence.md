Artificial General Intelligence, often referred to as **Strong AI**, refers to AI systems that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a wide variety of tasks, much like a human being. AGI can generalize its knowledge and skills to solve unfamiliar problems and has human-like cognitive abilities. Unlike ANI, AGI would be capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can.
