**Feature Scaling** is a technique in machine learning that involves transforming the features (input variables) of your data so that they have a similar scale or range. It’s important because many machine learning algorithms rely on the distance between data points to make predictions or decisions, and if features have significantly different ranges, it can distort or bias the model’s results.

# Types of Feature Scaling
- [[Min Max Scaling]]]
- [[Mean Normalization]]
- [[Z-score Normalization]]
