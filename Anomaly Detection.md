**Anomaly detection in unsupervised learning** refers to the process of identifying rare or unusual data points, patterns, or behaviors that significantly deviate from the normal patterns in a dataset without prior labels or supervision. The goal is to detect outliers or anomalies that do not conform to expected behavior or statistical properties.

# Choosing what features to use
Prefer **Gaussian/Normal Features** over non-Gaussian features. If possible, transform non-Gaussian features into something more Gaussian.
