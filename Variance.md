**Variance** in the context of regression trees refers to a statistical measure of the dispersion or spread of the target variable's values within a dataset. It quantifies how much the values differ from the mean value of the target variable. High variance indicates that the values are spread out over a wide range, while low variance indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean.
