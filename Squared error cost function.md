- The **squared error cost function**, also known as the **mean squared error (MSE)**, is a common metric used to measure the performance of regression models. It quantifies the difference between the predicted values generated by the model and the actual target values from the dataset. The squared error cost function is particularly useful because it penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones due to the squaring operation.
