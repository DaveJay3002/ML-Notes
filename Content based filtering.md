**Content-Based Filtering** uses item features or attributes to recommend items to a user. The idea is to recommend items that are similar to the items the user has liked or interacted with in the past. Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step breakdown:

- **Gather item attributes** (genre, director, etc.).
- **Create user profiles** based on their interactions with items.
- **Calculate similarities** between new items and user preferences.
- **Recommend the most similar items**.
- **Update profiles dynamically** as users interact with more items.
