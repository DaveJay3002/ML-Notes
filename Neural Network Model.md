A **neural network model** is a type of machine learning model designed to simulate the way the human brain processes information. It consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (or neurons) that work together to analyze input data, learn patterns, and make predictions or decisions.

### Key Features:

- **Layers of [[Neuron]]**: The model has at least three types of layers: an input layer, hidden layers (where computations occur), and an output layer. [[Neural layer]]
- **Weights and Biases**: Each connection between neurons has a weight, and each neuron has a bias. These parameters are adjusted during the training process to improve the modelâ€™s performance.
- **Activation Functions**: Functions applied to each neuron to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.

### Purpose:

A neural network model learns from data, identifies hidden patterns, and can perform tasks like classification, regression, and more complex applications such as image recognition, language translation, and game playing.
