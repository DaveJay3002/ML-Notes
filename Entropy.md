**Entropy** in decision trees is a measure of impurity or uncertainty in the data. It quantifies the randomness in a dataset and is used to determine how well a dataset is split at a particular node. The goal of a decision tree is to minimize entropy, thereby making the data more homogeneous or "pure" at each split.
