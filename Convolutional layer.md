A **Convolutional Layer** is a fundamental building block in Convolutional [[Neural Network]] (CNNs), primarily used for processing and analyzing visual data such as images. It applies convolution operations to the input, extracting important features like edges, textures, or patterns.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Convolution Operation**: The layer slides a filter (also called a kernel) across the input (image or feature map) to produce a feature map, highlighting important features in the data.
- **Local Receptive Fields**: Each filter in the convolutional layer focuses on a small region of the input, capturing spatial hierarchies in the data.
- **Stride and Padding**: Stride determines how much the filter shifts, while padding is used to control the spatial size of the output feature maps.
- **Multiple Filters**: Each convolutional layer uses multiple filters to capture different types of features (e.g., vertical edges, horizontal edges, etc.).

### Purpose:

Convolutional layers are used to automatically detect low-level and high-level features in images, making them essential for tasks like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.
