- **Linear regression** is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

- With linear regression, we want to do is choose a value for b and w, such that it fits our training set. 
- We try each w and then calculate the [[Cost Function]] for that w and minimize it and then do the same for b.
- We can use [[Gradient Descent]] to minimize the [[Cost Function]] , we have some function J(w,b), we want to minimize J(w,b).
