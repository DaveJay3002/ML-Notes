**Transfer learning** is a machine learning technique where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second, related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, transfer learning allows the knowledge gained from a pre-trained model to be applied to new tasks, which can save time and improve performance, especially when the new task has limited data.

**Supervised pretraining and fine-tuning** are two phases of a transfer learning process, particularly useful in tasks with limited labeled data.

### Supervised Pretraining:

- In this phase, a model is trained on a **large labeled dataset** for a related task, typically with a different but similar objective to the target task.
- **Supervised learning** techniques are used, meaning the model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs).
- The goal is for the model to learn general features and representations that can be transferred to a new, smaller dataset.
- For example, a neural network might be pre-trained on ImageNet (a massive image dataset) to recognize general visual features.

### Fine-Tuning:

- After pretraining, the model undergoes **fine-tuning** on the smaller, task-specific dataset.
- The pre-trained model's weights are updated, but typically at a lower learning rate, allowing the model to adapt to the nuances of the new task without forgetting the knowledge it gained during pretraining.
- Fine-tuning can involve freezing some early layers (that capture general features) and adjusting only the later layers to focus on task-specific learning.
