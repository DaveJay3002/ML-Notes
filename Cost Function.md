- In **machine learning**, a **cost function** (also known as a **loss function** or **objective function**) is a mathematical function that measures the **difference** between the **predicted outputs** of a model and the **actual target values** from the data. The primary goal of a cost function is to quantify how well a machine learning model performs, guiding the optimization process to improve the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

- The goal of our model will be to minimize the cost function.
- The error rate is the average of the errors or differences for all the predicted values and expected values.

- The cost function for two parameters w and b, for linear regression, so we use the values at the bottom of this plane.
