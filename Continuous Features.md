**Continuous Features** in decision trees refer to features that can take any numerical value within a range, such as age, temperature, or income. When building a decision tree with continuous features, the tree must determine the optimal threshold to split the data at each node, rather than choosing from a set of distinct categories.

### How Continuous Features are Handled:

1. **Threshold-Based Splitting**: The algorithm tries different threshold values to divide the data into two groups. For example, for a feature like "age," it might split the data at age 30, separating individuals younger than 30 from those older than 30.

2. **Selecting the Best Split**: The algorithm evaluates multiple potential thresholds and selects the one that gives the highest information gain (or other criteria like Gini index) for the split.
