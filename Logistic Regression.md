**Logistic Regression** is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes (such as 0 or 1, true or false, yes or no) based on one or more input features. Despite its name, logistic regression is used for classification, not regression tasks.

The model estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using a logistic function (or sigmoid function) to map predicted values to a probability range between 0 and 1.
