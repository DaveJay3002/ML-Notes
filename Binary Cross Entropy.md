**Binary Cross-Entropy** (BCE) is a loss function commonly used in binary classification tasks in machine learning and deep learning. It quantifies the difference between the true labels and the predicted probabilities produced by a model. The primary goal of using BCE is to minimize the divergence between the predicted outputs and the actual labels during training.
