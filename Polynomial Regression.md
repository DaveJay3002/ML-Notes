**Polynomial Regression** is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable xxx and the dependent variable yyy is modeled as an nnn-degree polynomial. Instead of fitting a straight line (as in linear regression), polynomial regression fits a curve to the data, which allows it to capture more complex, non-linear relationships.
