**Vectorization** in machine learning refers to the process of converting operations that would typically be performed one element at a time (looping over individual elements) into operations that act on entire arrays or vectors at once. This technique leverages highly optimized mathematical libraries (like NumPy in Python) and takes advantage of modern CPU/GPU hardware architectures to perform multiple operations simultaneously, which speeds up the computations.
