In a **neural network**, a **neuron** (also called a **node** or **unit**) is the basic computational unit that processes input data. It mimics a biological neuron in the human brain and is responsible for receiving inputs, performing calculations, and passing outputs to other neurons.

### Key Characteristics of a Neuron:

- **Inputs**: Each neuron receives one or more inputs, often numerical data or the output from other neurons in the previous layer.
- **Weights**: Each input is multiplied by a corresponding weight, which determines the importance of that input.
- **Bias**: A bias is added to the weighted sum of inputs to allow more flexibility in learning.
- **Activation Function**: After computing the weighted sum and bias, the neuron applies an activation function to decide whether or not to "activate." This introduces non-linearity to the model, enabling it to learn complex relationships.

### Output:

The final output of the neuron is passed to the neurons in the next layer, or if it's in the last layer, it forms the final output of the network.

In summary, a neuron in a neural network processes inputs, applies weights and biases, and passes an output forward in the network to enable learning and decision-making.
