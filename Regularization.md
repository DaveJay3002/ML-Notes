**Regularization** in machine learning, particularly in the context of **polynomial regression**, refers to techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function based on the magnitude of the model coefficients. Polynomial regression can easily overfit the training data, especially when using high-degree polynomials, leading to a model that captures noise instead of the underlying relationship.

### How Does It Work?

1. **Model Complexity**: When a model is too complex, it can learn not just the real patterns in the data, but also the noise (random fluctuations). This makes it perform poorly on new, unseen data.
    
2. **Scaling Down Parameters**:
    
    - Think of the model's parameters (or weights) as numbers that help it make predictions.
    - Regularization adds a small penalty to the loss function (the function that measures how wrong the model's predictions are) based on the size of these parameters.
3. **Shrinkage**:
    
    - By adding this penalty, regularization encourages the model to keep its parameters small.
    - Imagine you have a rubber band that keeps stretching. Regularization is like gently pulling on that rubber band to keep it from stretching too far.
    - This "pull" keeps the model from relying too much on any single feature, helping it generalize better to new data.
