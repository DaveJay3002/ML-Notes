**Multilabel classification** is a type of classification task in machine learning where each instance (input data point) can be associated with multiple labels or classes simultaneously, rather than being limited to a single class.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Multiple Labels**: Each instance can belong to zero, one, or more classes (e.g., an image can be tagged as both "cat" and "pet").
    
2. **Independence of Labels**: The presence of one label does not necessarily imply the presence or absence of another, allowing for flexible categorization.
    
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Common metrics for assessing multilabel classification performance include Hamming loss, precision, recall, and F1-score, which account for the multiple labels assigned to instances.
