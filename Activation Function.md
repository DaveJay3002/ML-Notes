An **activation function** is a mathematical function used in artificial [[Neural Network]]s to determine the output of a [[Neuron]]. It introduces **non-linearity** into the model, allowing the network to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. Common activation functions include [[Sigmoid Function]], [[ReLU]] (Rectified Linear Unit), and Tanh. The choice of activation function can significantly impact the performance and convergence of the neural network.

### **Why do we need Activation Functions**

- **Non-Linearity**: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling the network to learn complex patterns in the data. Without them, the network would only be able to learn linear relationships.
- **Output Range**: Different activation functions scale the output to a specific range, which is crucial for ensuring the outputs are interpretable (e.g., as probabilities in classification tasks).
- **Gradient Propagation**: Functions like [[ReLU]] and [[Sigmoid Function]] facilitate effective gradient propagation during backpropagation, enabling efficient training of deep networks.
- **Representation Power**: By utilizing various activation functions, neural networks can represent a wider variety of functions, improving their performance on complex tasks.

### **Types of Activation Functions**

- [[Sigmoid Function]]
- [[ReLU]]

### **Choosing an Activation Function**

- For **binary classification** problems, [[Sigmoid Function]] is typically the most suitable.
- For **regression tasks**, use the **linear activation function** if the data can take both positive and negative values.
- For **regression data** with no negative values, **ReLU** is usually the most appropriate.
- **ReLU** is the most common choice for general neural networks due to its performance advantages.
