**Multiple Linear Regression** is an extension of simple linear regression that models the relationship between **two or more independent variables** and **one dependent variable**. It fits a linear equation to the data to capture the effects of multiple predictors on the outcome.

The mathematical equation for multiple linear regression is:

Y=β0+β1X1+β2X2+⋯+βnXn+ϵY = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \dots + \beta_nX_n + \epsilonY=β0​+β1​X1​+β2​X2​+⋯+βn​Xn​+ϵ
