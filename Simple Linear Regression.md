**Simple Linear Regression** is a type of linear regression that models the relationship between **one independent variable** and **one dependent variable** by fitting a straight line to the data. The goal is to find a linear equation that best predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variable.

The mathematical equation for simple linear regression is:

Y=β0+β1X+ϵY = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilonY=β0​+β1​X+ϵ
